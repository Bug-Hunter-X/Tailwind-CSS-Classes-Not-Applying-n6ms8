# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied to elements as expected.

## Bug Description

In the provided code, a `div` element is styled using Tailwind CSS classes. However, the classes `bg-red-500` and `hover:bg-blue-700` don't seem to apply, leaving the element with no background color and no hover effect. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **Missing or Incorrect Configuration:** The Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) might be missing or misconfigured. This prevents Tailwind from correctly processing your CSS classes.
2. **Build Process:** If you are using a build system (like Vite, Webpack, or Parcel), the build process needs to be correctly configured to include and process Tailwind's output CSS.
3. **CSS Conflicts:** Other CSS rules in your stylesheet might be overriding the Tailwind CSS classes.
4. **Typographical Errors:** Double-check that you've typed the Tailwind CSS class names correctly.  A single typo can prevent the class from being applied.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js` and involves verifying the Tailwind configuration and ensuring the correct build process is in place.
