```javascript
// Ensure Tailwind is configured correctly in tailwind.config.js:
// ... (Tailwind configuration) ...

// Verify the build process is setup correctly, for example, in a Vite project:
// ... (Vite configuration, usually in vite.config.js or similar)

// Check for CSS conflicts by inspecting the browser's developer tools to see if other rules are overriding the Tailwind classes

//Example of corrected code (if typo was the issue):
<div class="bg-red-500 hover\:bg-blue-700 p-4 text-white">
  This div should now have a red background and change to blue on hover.
</div>
